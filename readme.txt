The Whole Post

== Description ==

When you show partial posts on your main page or archives and you have "read
more" links, clicking those links will redirect the visitor to a position in 
the post. The visitor will not see the post from the begining. This is bad if 
you have an ad at the top of your post cause the visitor will not see that
anymore. 

This plugin will modify the default behaviour of the "read more" so the visitor 
will see the post from the top when they click the "read more" links.
